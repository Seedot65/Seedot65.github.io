<h3>ABOUT KWOC:</h3>
<br>
KWOC is a five week long online programme aimed at helping those <br>

students who are new to Open Source Programming <br>

and also preparing them for events like GSOC.<br>

<h3>SELECTING PROJECTS:</h3><br>

There was a large variety of projects available.I was used to a bit of Competive Programming <br>

and so I chose the project Competetive Programming ,which is a repository containing implementations <br>

of algoritms and problems in as many languages as possible,to help one refer whenever one is stuck on a problem.<br>

<h3>ABOUT P.R.:</h3><br>

P.R. 1:<br>

My first P.R. was on the implementation of Data Structure Tries<br>

P.R. 2:<br>

My second P.R. was on the the method of swapping two numbers without using any third variable,<br>

just by using the bitwise operation XOR.<br>

P.R. 3:<br>

My third P.R. was on the problem of Matrix Chain Multiplication.The aim was to find the position of the parentheses<br>

such that the multiplication of N no. of matrices require least number of scalar operations.The problem was solved<br>

using Dynamic Programming<br><br>



All the above were done using C++<br><br>



P.R. 4:<br>

My fourth P.R. was written in python and was a implementation of Count Sort<br><br>



Conclusion:It was really constructive use of the winter holidays.I got to know about using Github<br>

and contributed in a Project aimed at helping people facing trouble while programming
